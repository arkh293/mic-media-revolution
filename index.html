                        livestreams, people would come out and go to the
                        public squares.” Whoever wants, goes; whoever doesn’t, will eventually watch the livestream.
                        Those
                        days, our team, video editors, copy editors, all of us were journalists because we were all
                        walking
                        livestreams, as we all had smartphones. It’s quite common that journalists wouldn’t sleep much,
                        that they
                        should be ready that every time you go home you may have to come back. Something that for years
                        I had
                        planned to do, to exercise and lose 12 kg of weight, I achieved in just a few months because we
                        were
                        walking all the time in those days. As a joke, we would call this Nikol Fitness. I remember
                        those days
                        everyone, citizens, from different parts of the country would record videos or live footage and
                        send it to
                        us. Once I saw a 70-year-old man trying to cross Baghramyan Avenue, which was blocked by barbed
                        wire. He pulled out his phone and began to film the police. He went up to them and said, let me
                        cross. I
                        was amazed.
                        [Live videos] were really a deterrent; otherwise, there would’ve been so many cases of violence
                        — also
                        violence against journalists, which has happened after 2008. Hiding from live recording and new
                        technologies, which the former officials would do, I find somewhat ridiculous in the 21st
                        century. And
                        those livestreams of Pashinyan’s opened a lot of doors. It also creates trust, when the
                        country’s top figure
                        is communicating with you, one-on-one, through a camera. I wanted a real revolution in this
                        country, so

                        that the same person is not given the chance to rule the country three times. I wanted my child
                        and me and
                        all of us to live in a country where human rights will be first and foremost, will be a
                        priority. And if we
                        don’t like something, we can confidently come out and protest, [and say] I don’t want you to
                        lead this
                        country any more.</div>

                    The first phase of the protests was met with the aggressive actions from the police. On April 16
                    the police blocks the Yerevan's Baghramyan Avenue (where the National Parliament and President's
                    Residency are situated) with barbed wire. They use batons, as well as stun and sound grenades, to
                    disperse the protesters leaving injured 54 people, 2 of them were policemen. Nikol Pashinyan, the
                    leader of the protests, was injured and taken to hospital. </p>

                    <div class="translation-text">It was about seven in the evening. The main rally started every day
                        at
                        7 p.m. Until 7 p.m., people
                        would gather at [Republic] Square and show their presence there, everyone in a different way.
                        One or

                        two cars were constantly driving around in circles — there’s this Armenian tradition to take a
                        newlywed bride for a spin like that. People were taking themselves for a spin in the square, as
                        if they
                        were celebrating something in advance — that was the impression. There was a couple standing on
                        one of those circulating cars, hugging each other, and in the background was the clock tower of
                        the
                        government building. When they approached, I gestured: “Why are you just standing like that, do
                        something to make my shot interesting.” I don’t know if that’s considered staging or not, but
                        it
                        was
                        just a game. I didn’t know if they would respond. But they understood what I meant, they
                        kissed,
                        I
                        took a photo. Then they stopped, looked into my camera viewer, ok, “Can we kiss again?” I said,
                        no,
                        it’s good, go. In this photo there’s symbolism: the flag, the government building, and a young
                        couple
                        that will live in this country, in this new Armenia we were trying to build at that time. I’m
                        happy that
                        I can’t point to only one iconic situation or photo from that time and say that’s the most
                        important
                        symbolic image. It’s the drivers who were honking, and the drivers who were creating those
                        traffic
                        jams by pretending their cars had broken down. It’s the students, who were organizing the
                        adults’
                        rallies. The girls, who were coordinating the boys’ actions... That was something new that had
                        never
                        happened before. Everyone understood that they were a small part of it all, building something
                        new,
                        surrendering the old.</div>

                        blocking the street or something. We started to
                        capture it on our phones and told them, give us your names so the human rights’ defenders can
                        find
                        you easily. The police didn’t quite like that, so they arrested us too — me and two of my
                        friends,
                        Hayk and Robert. They took us to the station, Zeytun division. It was the first time the other
                        young
                        people we were with were detained during these rallies; we — my friends and I — had been
                        arrested
                        several times before. It was already a regular thing for us. The police officers understood
                        this
                        immediately, as we demanded they address us formally and with respect. Meanwhile, they were
                        trying to pressure the others. There were some school-age children there, the officers were
                        scaring

                        them, saying now we’re going to call your families, your moms and dads, they’re going to get
                        mad
                        at
                        you. These kids were so scared, and we didn’t like that. We wanted to do something so that they
                        weren’t so stressed. At that moment we saw Serzh Sargsyan’s portrait on the wall — a symbol of
                        the
                        Republicans’ rule. And I, Robert, and Hayk thought if we take this photo and throw it out of
                        the
                        window, it will inspire these kids and it will also mean something for the people on the
                        streets
                        — it
                        can be an inspiring action. For me, Serzh Sargsyan’s image is a symbol of the Republicans and
                        March
                        1, but under no circumstances could it be considered a symbol of the Republic of Armenia. When
                        we
                        uploaded the video to Facebook, many people saw it, and that’s when the real commotion began.
                        Some police officers came, the department head came down. We were waiting for a reprisal,
                        thinking
                        something could happen to us, but nothing happened.</div>

                    Some curious or funny incidents developed into memes. Ashot was one of them. A man from the crowd
                    addressed one of the policemen as if he knew him well. "Ashot, you think you can put on your helmet
                    and I won’t recognize you? Do you know your Granny is here, too? Are you gonna hit her, too? "
                    <br>
                    It later turned out that this was an improvised performance. But Ashot became a meme, he appeared
                    on posters and in anecdotes. It was a call to the police to join the people.</p>

                    Live broadcasts became a vital part of people’s involvement during the protests. It was late at
                    night and one of the protesters, decided to use the live broadcast of Azatutyun TV and send a
                    message to his wife so that she would not worry. "Ira, I’ll be home around 1 [a.m.]," he said to
                    the camera.
                    <br>
                    Curiously, his wife wasn't watching and didn't get the message. But the whole country did. Songs
                    and posters "Ira, don't wait for your husband, he won't come tonight," emerged and entertained
                    people.</p>

                    People had fun. Here is a recreation of the game Mortal Kombat, where Nikol Pashinyan is fighting
                    with Serzh Sargsyan and then with Karen Karapetyan, the ex-Prime Minister.

                        and there was a huge number of people, if you recall. It didn’t even take a day; in a few
                        hours
                        my
                        hopes were completely justified. There’s no other way: if we’ve started it, we have to
                        finish
                        it, that’s
                        all. During the claps, when it was silent, during that famous chant “Hoo!” I fell in love
                        with
                        the
                        Armenian people because I’d never seen such a thing, 100,000 people, their arms
                        outstretched,
                        waiting silently for the sign to chant in response. I was awestruck. I felt only love. And
                        it
                        was during
                        those claps that I would often shout, “People, I love you all!” And sometimes someone would
                        shout
                        back, we love you too!</div>

                    It was the day before the MPs voted for Serzh Sargsyan to become Prime Minister. Police lines and
                    barbed wire featured in front of the President’s Office, Baghramyan 26. There was tension, fear. In
                    about half an hour, the police would use force, leaving dozens injured. Later, Nikol Pashinyan and
                    his team would take the decision to decentralize their actions, thus making it hard for the police
                    to concentrate force and use it against a large number of people at once. Love didn't win that day,
                    but it would soon...

                        participate in acts of civil
                        disobedience, the idea was to make them into participants. For example, people with
                        disabilities, who
                        because of physical hardships simply couldn’t get to the street, or women, who bear
                        families,
                        children, worries on their shoulders. Or because of other stereotypes or traditional
                        customs,
                        these
                        people could’ve been simply left out of this process. That’s how this idea of the pots and
                        pans
                        came
                        about; the goal was for them to participate without leaving the house, just banging them
                        outside their
                        windows or balconies, and with that clanging sound, joining the civil disobedience campaign,
                        and
                        also heralding Serzh Sargsyan’s so-called “Last Bell.” You know, there’s this stereotype
                        that
                        we’re a
                        grave, solemn people, that it doesn’t suit us. And I suddenly discovered the inner freedom
                        in
                        our
                        society and in our people, when people are free, when they let themselves try interesting
                        things. And
                        hitting that [pot], I felt joy and happiness, a chance to get rid of internal complexes and
                        fears, because
                        there’s also a belief that this sound scares off evil forces. I understood how important it
                        is,
                        turning
                        people into participants in any possible way. This way they also contribute to the big,
                        important cause
                        and share the responsibility.</div>

                    <div class="translation-text align-left">If I’m not mistaken, it was the 14th of April. When we
                        reached Petak market, the doors were shut, so
                        the employees don’t join [the rallies], don’t walk out. Then when Nikol Pashinyan managed to
                        enter,
                        pretending to buy sujukh, we entered Petak. Some vendors started distributing vuvuzelas free
                        of
                        charge, wanting to help us this way since they weren’t participating in the rallies.
                        Personally,
                        I didn’t
                        get any at the time; I bought mine during the march. Slowly, they appeared in everyone’s
                        hands,
                        and
                        looking at each other, at their friends, resonating, it became such an uproar. We blew two
                        short
                        and
                        one long sound. When a few people did it together, the sound was very strong, very loud.
                        Well,
                        at
                        some point we got angry with the police, that they’re not joining the people. How to have an
                        effect,
                        how to express your scorn? I used to blow the vuvuzela close to their ears and it mainly had
                        its
                        impact. They got annoyed a lot by that, you could tell from their looks, their behavior.
                        Well
                        that was
                        the lesser of two evils we could do to them. We didn’t have anything against them, but it’s
                        like
                        you’re
                        letting it all out. When you see a bus and all the passengers join you, you realize you’ve
                        reached your
                        goal, you’ve done your day’s work, so to speak. You chant “Join!” and 20 students join. Or
                        cars
                        stop
                        and the passengers join. Now, watching the video of those days, I relive the same emotions.
                        Those
                        who haven’t gone through this can’t feel what we feel. And I’m so happy that I was in
                        Armenia at
                        that
                        time, with the people, and I witnessed and participated in all that.</div>

                    <div class="translation-text align-left">For 100 years this region has been repressed; whoever was
                        progressive, they were pressured, exiled,
                        executed. All the negative things have happened, but humanity always gives birth anew, always
                        nourishes — and see, the scales tipped in our favor this time. First, it was very interesting
                        that the
                        youth came out. I admired that especially young women were actively involved, thanks to whom I
                        believe things turned out well. I was watching — the police were taken aback. They didn’t know
                        how
                        to act with them: they’re not only young, but also girls — how can they harm them? Love also
                        played
                        a big role, and youth, and everything — even the negative characters. Those negative figures
                        played a
                        huge role. What Serzh Sargsyan did was a gift to the revolution, no one could imagine to do
                        such
                        a
                        thing. Appointing himself again [to rule the country], after promising “I won’t do that”… And
                        here he
                        takes the power again. He says, “What, you want [another] March 1?” He unwillingly confessed
                        that
                        they’ll do it again, that they did that. They could’ve scared us with March 1, but they
                        couldn’t
                        scare
                        the youth — those young guys had already lived through the Four-Day War. So here again he was
                        mistaken. You know, I noticed that the amateur posters were better than the professional ones.
                        They’re more direct. What’s important is the idea, the concept. One of the posters said: “You
                        can’t
                        imagine how disgusted we are with you” — referring to the old MPs that were still in Parliament
                        at
                        the time. The way of thinking is the most important: “What do you think? What is this all
                        about?” If I
                        put it briefly, it’s about people, we’re talking about democracy.</div>

                    <div class="translation-text align-left">There was a decline in our country and it was scary to
                        think what would happen next. That is, the
                        country would empty and become what, I don’t know. It would probably become some place for
                        Russia, where there would just be [Russian] military bases and some few thousand Armenians
                        serving
                        them. I too had no choice but to go and find my happiness, my way in another country. It was
                        mid-
                        March when my brother called and said this is what they’re planning, they are going to walk
                        [from
                        Gyumri to Yerevan], and they need an anthem, an anthem for a revolution. Pashinyan wrote the
                        words, and the rest is up to me. We discussed what genre is more inspiring to walk under, is
                        rhythmic,
                        or best matches the lyrics. We decided rock probably comes closest. I think there’s aggression
                        too, but
                        right aggression, not like crazy aggression; aggression to shake people up and get them off
                        their
                        couches. Besides, it had to reach every single Armenian that our country’s future depends on
                        them.
                        “I’ve lost, over and over again I’ve lost
                        And I have seen the smirk of the lie
                        But my will is stronger than stone
                        My soul doesn’t know how to surrender”
                        They say mine is the voice of the revolution. I think it sounds beautiful.</div>

                    <div class="translation-text">There’s this impression that it was my way of protest. Honestly, it
                        was very much my professional
                        experience. When there’s a revolution happening before your eyes and everyone’s on their feet,
                        you
                        think, is it possible to create a brand in all of this? I created the typeface about 3–4 years
                        ago, based
                        on a completely different subject, because that typeface is my adaptation of an old Armenian
                        typeface. It was appropriate, in this case, to write the word in that type because it was very
                        harmonious with the cause, it totally looks like it’s crying out. I had a few samples of
                        ready-made hats
                        [with the “dukhov” slogan], and I was also listening and seeing that that word was being used
                        by
                        the
                        guys, by Nikol and everyone. I thought a hat would be appropriate to give as a gift, to firmly
                        fix the
                        word “dukhov” as a brand in the form of a hat. I asked my friends to hand it to him, they did,
                        he wore
                        it, and the rest is history. [“Dukhov” means] be “with courage,” take your steps courageously,
                        take
                        risks, and that has become the main slogan. If we think of what this movement was about, it was
                        about taking “dukhov” steps [with courage] — unlike the “Reject Serzh” slogan, which was
                        temporary and very specific: once he was rejected, the slogan lost its power. In my entire life
                        I’ve
                        never participated [in protests], I kept my distance from everything. But if everyone now has
                        stood up
                        and everyone’s so good and interesting in this unprecedented way, everyone’s smiling, how can
                        you
                        stand back or refuse?</div>

                    <div class="translation-text">Reaching Barekamutyun metro, I saw some young people blocking the
                        metro. Without wasting a
                        second I sat down next to my friends [in between the train doors]. I say “friends,” but we knew
                        each
                        other only a few days. Then the police started negotiating, requesting us to leave. The
                        conductor was
                        pressing the button to close the train doors; and the doors were really hurting us. The police
                        were
                        warning us, “You’ll get hurt, the train will move now, your legs are outside, you’ll get hurt.”
                        And we
                        were saying, “Well then it’s your responsibility to prevent us from possible harm. Instruct the
                        driver
                        to come out.” Many people were still trying to get to work and were saying, “You’re bothering
                        us, can
                        you go protest somewhere else?” During those days some people were still treating our actions
                        as
                        hopeless. All public transportation was stopped. The alternative to get somewhere was the
                        metro,
                        and
                        it was necessary to stop that too. Also, the metro with its strategic significance is a kind of
                        sacred
                        space. We had to involve it into a total blockade too. I knew that our safety comes from being
                        together and being peaceful. Communicating these principles to each other also helps us to
                        succeed.
                        Later, in June, when I was watching a video of the days of the revolution, I was terrified by
                        what
                        happened and what could’ve happened. But that was much later.</div>

                    <div class="translation-text">At the first rally, my child was 2.5 months old. It seemed my baby
                        was
                        the youngest; everyone was
                        looking at me like “What are you doing, girl, go home!” Of course I discussed it with my
                        husband.
                        We thought about it, he said, ok, you stay at home, I’ll go instead. I said, you can stay with
                        the child,
                        I’ll go, and I’ll come back to feed him. I was thinking, no, I can’t stay home and watch from
                        the
                        sidelines, because there are always so many who watch from the sidelines. I was happily shocked
                        that
                        people finally took to the streets. Since 2007, I’ve participated in all the protests, and I
                        used to ask
                        myself: Is everything ok in people’s lives? And even if it was and they didn’t want to protest,
                        but then
                        March 1 happened. At the very least 10 people’s lives were stolen, after all. How can people
                        not
                        come
                        out? But thanks to this contagioius and networked struggle, the role of each person became
                        important.
                        Everyone felt central to all this; that is, if you block a small street, to some extent you add
                        your
                        support, your 1+ to this fight. I hope that everything will be so good in Armenia that we’ll
                        just
                        remember those days as “you know, Levon [my son], April 23, 2018, was an important turning
                        point
                        for the Republic of Armenia. From that day on, Armenia became such a good place to live, as you
                        know it.”</div>

                        cross our minds? A string quartet (two
                        violins, a viola, and a cello), which is usually seen seated, played in one place. That day was
                        marked
                        by walking, on the main streets. When, if not now, do we show that we have faith in what we
                        did,
                        we
                        believe in its phenomenal role and meaning? For many years, art in every possible way has been
                        subjected to; it functioned as an entertaining, noble, royal thing. Art consciousness, which is
                        the
                        alternative, the nervous system that is the first to feel that something’s not right and sends
                        signals to
                        your brain, was being suppressed. Kandinsky said something interesting: “The artist has a
                        triple
                        responsibility to the non-artists.” Art is the synonym of freedom itself — we probably felt it
                        most of
                        all at that moment. That freedom, that ease, people’s response, and all of our eyes lit with
                        joy. To put
                        it mildly, I’m not the best musician and I don’t pretend to be; I’m working on it, it’s true,
                        but at that
                        moment, without realizing it, I probably played my best.</div>
